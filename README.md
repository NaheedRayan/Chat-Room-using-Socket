There are two versions of the program.

For learning purpose download the files in **Chat Room Version 1** .
Then run the server.py and then client.py.


How to run the server.py.  
eg:
```cmd
python3 server.py "localhost" 1234
```



How to run the client.py.

# Some Screenshots

## We will be creating a server and two clients to demonstrate how it works
<br>

![](images/v1/gif01.gif)

Here we can see 3 terminals

1. Server
2. Client1
3. Client2


**Since we are testing it in the same computer we are using localhost for clients to connect. As a result every ip looks the same.But if we connect with other computer we will see different ip addresses.**

**We can also see the disconnected clients on the server**
